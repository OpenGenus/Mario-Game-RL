Mario Game Reinforcement Learning

Used the Gym library and stable baseline 3 to train a reinforcement learning model to beat the mario game. With 1 million learning steps, I was able to beat the first level, and clearly with more steps, the model will learn better. Other ways of making the model better in the future is to clarify the reward function better and distinguish between different types of enemies.
